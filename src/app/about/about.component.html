      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed font-light">
        <p>
          I am an <span class="text-white font-medium">Entry Level Software Developer</span> and final-year BCA Cloud
          Computing student at Kristu Jayanti University,
          Bengaluru. My journey in tech is driven by a passion for creating seamless user experiences and robust backend
          systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have hands-on experience in <span class="text-primary font-medium">frontend development</span> using
          Angular and Tailwind CSS, gained through academic projects and an on-site internship.
          Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in cloud architecture and continuously exploring AWS and Oracle Cloud
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I thrive on solving complex problems and am eager to contribute to innovative projects that make a real
          difference.
